# Robinia-SDM

This project aims to model how climate, geology, forest structure, and soil characteristics interact
to drive the distribution of the key nitrogen fixing tree Robinia pseudoacacia or black locust. We will
utilize the following data streams:

-USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis data for our tree demography

-Bioclim climate variables from Worldclim 

-USGS Lithography data for lithographic type

-NRCS maps of primary and secondary rocktypes

-MODIS Remote sensed measurements of greenness

-Soil characteristics from the Harmonized World Soil Database
